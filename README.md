# WebDev2-JS_Game
## For my second continuous assessment in Web Development II, I was tasked with creating a top-down game using Javascript.

The important source code for the game can be found in [static/canvas.js](https://github.com/Chris-1010/WebDev2-JS_Game/blob/main/static/canvas.js).
### Have a go of my game [here](https://cs1.ucc.ie/~ca3/cgi-bin/ca2/run.py/)!
